Java Architecture Testing Framework (JATF)

This framework allows developers to quickly integrate code quality tests as dynamic unit tests, without the need of static code analysis tools. It uses annotations and rules to determine which classes of your project are tested for conventions, metrics, dependencies, or patterns. The framework is currently the first prototype, as a result of my master's thesis.
The project is licensed under GPLv3 (see http://gplv3.fsf.org/).
